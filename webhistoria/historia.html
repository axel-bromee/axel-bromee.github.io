▸ excerpt from the official <a href="">press release:</a>
</H4>
<H4>
Half-Life introduces a revolutionary leap in the 3D first-person gaming genre by
combining stunning technology enhancements with genre-breaking gameplay
elements. Gamers are given opportunities to wreak havoc--in true action-game
fashion--but they are also challenged to explore and strategize; for instance,
telling friend from foe is no longer a simple matter of humans vs. monsters. Half-
life's strong story elements, advanced inventory system and story-integrated
challenges create an experience never-before-seen in traditional "run-and-gun"
action games.

Check out <a href="">the official Half-Life site</a>, where you'll be able to find the latest info
about the game.
